# Tetris 2

Tetris 2 is my own take in making a Tetris clone inspired by the original Alexey Pajitnov game.

This game aims to bring a series of features that I like from other tetris games, and not bring some features that
I don't like.

**Note that this is just one of my early learning projects, and its not meant to be an example of how to do things**

## Dependencies

- libncurses-dev
- gcc

## Quick Start

### Build the game

```bash
$ make
```

### Run the game

```bash
$ ./tetris2
```

## Controls

- `n`     - Toggle preview 
- `j/k`   - Rotate

- `s`     - Soft drop      
- `Space` - Hard drop
